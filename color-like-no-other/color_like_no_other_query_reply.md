# The Ad in a Nutshell

In 2005, Sony launched a captivating advertisement for its Bravia LCD televisions, emphasizing the tagline "Colour like no other." The ad features 250,000 vibrant bouncy balls cascading down the steep streets of San Francisco, creating a mesmerizing visual spectacle. This two-and-a-half-minute spot first aired in the UK on November 6, 2005, during the halftime of a football match between Manchester United and Chelsea.
